#List the potential planetary outposts here.
#Maps must be the full path to them
#Maps should be 255x255 or smaller and be bounded.  Falling off the edge of the map will result in undefined behavior. 
#SPECIFYING AN INVALID MAP WILL RESULT IN RUNTIMES ON GAME START
#Really only Glloyd should be messing with this.
